Sprint 5 Testing:
-Run all files individually in fx.test


Testing Notes:
If running client and server on the same machine:
- LocalTestSuite
If running server and client on separate machines:
1. Run ServerImplementation. This can be done in eclipse. The main method automatically generates RMI registry.
2. Edit RemoteClientTest setUpBeforeClass method. You will need to change the hostname to whatever machine is running the server. Verify the ports are the same. 
3. Run RemoteTestSuite
